# UNP_PROJECT_BI-WITH_POWER_-BI_BRAZILIAN_E-COMMERCE_DATA-ANALYSIS

I completed a Brazilian E-Commerce Data Analysis project in collaboration with UNP using a massive dataset of 13.59M in revenue and 99K orders. This project involved deep-diving into market trends to identify why 67% of sales are concentrated in the SP region and analyzing the sharp revenue decline observed after 2018. I built interactive visualizations to track the 78% dependency on credit card payments and the correlation between high installment usage and customer retention. By utilizing Power BI’s advanced filtering, I highlighted underperforming states to provide a roadmap for geographical expansion. This analysis demonstrates my ability to convert raw transactional data into high-level business strategy and financial insights.
